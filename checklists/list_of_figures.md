## EDA
- Number of data points
- Distribution of each of the features (for continuous features)
- Statistics: mean of each feature, STD of each feature, max, min (box plot also) (for continuous features)
- Correlation matrix
- Scatter plots of features colour coded by labels (probably pick similar features for combination, like goals scored by both, goals conceded by both, etc.)

Note - keep colour codes consistent, create HD images, don't use screenshots, use savefig() function

## Models (supervised)
- Table with all metrics
- Confusion matrix
- ROC curve
- Learning curve
- For logistic regression - results as a function of C
- For decision tree - decision tree
- For SVM - results as a function of C, results as a function of gamma, results with linear and rbf kernel
